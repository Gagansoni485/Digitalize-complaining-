<h2 align="center">🚀 Project Overview</h2>

The <b>Digital Complaint Management System</b> is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline grievance handling within educational institutions.

The system introduces a structured, role-based workflow where:

- Students submit complaints digitally  
- Super Admin assigns complaints department-wise  
- Teachers resolve complaints through dedicated dashboards  
- Students track resolution status in real time  

This eliminates manual paperwork and ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability.

<h2 align="center">🎯 Problem Statement</h2>

Traditional complaint systems in institutions are:

- Manual and paper-based  
- Lacking transparency  
- Difficult to monitor  
- Hard to track for students  

This project solves these issues through a centralized digital workflow with fixed role-based access control.

---

<h2 align="center">🏗 System Architecture</h2>

The application follows a <b>multi-role dashboard architecture</b> with fixed permissions assigned at registration.

### 👨‍🎓 Student Module

Students can:

- Submit digital complaints
- Select complaint category:
  - Harassment
  - Sports Issues
  - Academic Concerns
  - Examination Section
  - Other Institutional Matters
- Track complaint status:
  - 🟡 In Progress  
  - 🟢 Resolved  
- View complaint history

Students only access their own complaints.

---

### 🛠 Super Admin Dashboard

The Super Admin has full platform control.

Capabilities include:

- View all complaints across departments
- View complete teacher list
- Assign complaints to department-specific teachers
- Monitor complaint progress
- Maintain overall system accountability

The Super Admin acts as the central routing authority.

---

### 👩‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard

Each teacher has an individual dashboard.

Teachers can:

- View complaints assigned by Super Admin
- Update complaint status
- Mark complaints as resolved
- Track assigned complaint history

Teachers only see complaints relevant to their department.

---

<h2 align="center">🔄 Complaint Workflow</h2>

1. Student submits complaint  
2. Complaint is stored in the database  
3. Super Admin reviews and assigns complaint  
4. Teacher receives complaint in dashboard  
5. Teacher updates status (In Progress / Resolved)  
6. Student tracks updates in real time  

This structured flow ensures end-to-end visibility.

---

<h2 align="center">🔐 Security & Access Control</h2>

- Role fixed at registration  
- Role-based dashboard isolation  
- Controlled complaint visibility  
- Secure authentication mechanism  
- No cross-role data exposure  

The system ensures data privacy and proper authorization.

---

<h2 align="center">📊 Key Features</h2>

- Multi-dashboard architecture  
- Category-based complaint classification  
- Real-time status tracking  
- Structured complaint routing  
- Digital record management

---

<h2 align="center">🛠 Tech Stack</h2>

- Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Backend: (Add your backend tech here — Node.js / Django / Spring Boot etc.)  
- Database: (MySQL / MongoDB / PostgreSQL etc.)  
- Authentication: Role-based access control
