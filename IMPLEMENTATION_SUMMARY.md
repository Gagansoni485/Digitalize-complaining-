# UniVoice - Category-Based Admin Assignment Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a category-based admin assignment system where Super Admins can assign complaints to admins based on their specializations.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Category-Based Admin Filtering in Assignment Modal**
**File**: `src/components/admin/SuperAdminDashboard.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ When Super Admin clicks "Assign" on a complaint, a modal opens showing the complaint details
- ✅ The modal displays **only admins specialized in that complaint's category**
- ✅ Filters admins based on:
  - `specializations` array includes the complaint category
  - `isActive === true` (only active admins)
  - `currentCaseLoad < maxCaseLoad` (admins with available capacity)
- ✅ Shows warning if no admins are available for that category
- ✅ Displays admin details: Name, Email, Department, Current Load (e.g., 5/50 cases)

**Example**:
- If complaint category is "academic" → Only shows admins with "academic" in their specializations
- If complaint category is "sports" → Only shows admins with "sports" in their specializations

---

### 2. **Enhanced Complaint Submission from User Forms**
**Files Updated**:
- `src/components/complainforms/academics.tsx`
- `src/components/complainforms/sports.tsx`
- `src/components/complainforms/exam.tsx`
- `src/components/complainforms/harass.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- ✅ All forms now send complete student information to backend
- ✅ Properly formatted complaint data including:
  - Student name, roll number, department, phone, email
  - Anonymous flag (hides student info if true)
  - Category, description, priority
- ✅ Token received from backend (not generated on frontend)
- ✅ Better error handling with specific error messages
- ✅ Harassment complaints automatically marked as "high" priority

**Data Structure Sent**:
```javascript
{
  title: "Category Complaint - Type",
  description: "User's complaint description",
  category: "academic|sports|exam|harass",
  department: "User's department",
  anonymous: true/false,
  studentInfo: {
    name: "Student Name",
    rollNo: "Roll Number",
    department: "Department",
    phone: "Phone Number",
    email: "Email Address"
  },
  priority: "normal|high"
}
```

### 3. **Admin Dashboard - Assigned Complaints Visibility**
**Status**: ✅ Already Working Correctly

**Backend Endpoint**: `/api/complaints/admin/:adminId`
- Fetches all complaints assigned to a specific admin
- Supports filtering by status
- Properly implemented and functional

**Frontend**: `AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Loads complaints assigned to logged-in admin
- Displays complaint details, status, student info
- Allows updating status and adding messages

---

### 4. **Admin Registration with Specializations**

**Admin Model** (`backend/models/Admin.js`):
```javascript
{
  specializations: ["academic", "sports", "harass", "exam", "general"],
  department: String,
  isActive: Boolean,
  maxCaseLoad: Number (default 50),
  currentCaseLoad: Number (default 0)
}
```

**Test Script Created**: `backend/test-admin-specialization.js`
- Registers 5 sample admins with different specializations
- Run with: `node test-admin-specialization.js`

**Sample Admins**:
1. Academic Admin - Handles academic complaints
2. Sports Admin - Handles sports complaints
3. Exam Admin - Handles exam complaints
4. Safety Admin - Handles harassment complaints
5. General Admin - Handles all types of complaints

---

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### **User Submits Complaint**:
1. User fills out complaint form (academic/sports/exam/harass)
2. User provides personal details (or submits anonymously)
3. Backend generates unique token
4. Complaint stored in database with category
5. Token displayed to user for tracking

### **Super Admin Assigns Complaint**:
1. Super Admin views unassigned complaints
2. Clicks "Assign" button on a complaint
3. Modal opens showing:
   - Complaint category (e.g., "academic")
   - Complaint description
   - **Filtered list of admins specialized in that category**
4. Super Admin selects appropriate admin from dropdown
5. Clicks "Assign Complaint"
6. Backend assigns complaint to selected admin
7. Admin's `currentCaseLoad` increments

### **Admin Views Assigned Complaint**:
1. Admin logs into their dashboard
2. Sees all complaints assigned to them
3. Can filter by status (pending/in_progress/resolved)
4. Can update complaint status
5. Can add messages/updates
6. Can mark as resolved
